This project is an implementation of the specs required by the Duolingo Word Search criteria. The app requires Android 5.1 and above.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the Github repo.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

### Goals
* Demonstrate a good understanding of software architecture and tooling that are important in maintaining a modern codebase.
* Use MVVM to separate responsibilities from the view and create more easily tested classes.
* Use Kotlin for its expressive, concise, and convenient features. Kotlin helps avoiding potential bugs caused by inconsistent nullability.
* Use Architecture Components as a baseline for introducing Android best practices.
* Sensible file and project organization.
* Demonstrate the use of common Android libraries used commonly for modern codebases.
* Error handling to create better UX for predictable conditions.
* Handle a wide array of device definitions.
* Use dependency injection with Dagger 2 to produce decoupled objects and services. Relying on Dagger- Android to avoid writing boilerplate code.
